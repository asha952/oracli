# Oracli Backend

Oracli Backend contains all the code that runs the API as well as the basic landing page.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Installation and Requirements

Currently, we only require that you have Python3 or Pipenv installed, but in the future the application will be dockerized for easy deployment and development work.

Requirements:

-   [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
-   [Pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/)

Installation:

```bash
# clone the resposity
git clone https://github.com/tempor1s/oracli
# change directory
cd oracli/server
# create a virtual enviornment and install packages
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```

Congrats! You should now have the Oracli backend installed and you are ready to begin development.

### Running the Project Locally

If you have not yet followed the installation steps, go and do so before continuing.

```bash
# make sure you are in the correct repository and in a virtual environment, then run the following command
python3 app.py
```
